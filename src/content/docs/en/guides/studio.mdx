The [Astro Studio web portal](http://studio.astro.build) allows you to connect to and manage your remote hosted Astro DB databases through a web interface or using [CLI commands](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-studio-cli).

From your Studio dashboard, you have access to account management, help articles and a support message console.

Visit [Astro Studio](http://studio.astro.build) to sign up or log in.

## Deploy with a Studio connection

You can deploy your project with a live connection to your Studio database. This is possible with any deployment platform using static builds or an [SSR adapter](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/).

First, configure your build command to connect with Studio using the `--remote` flag. This example applies the flag to a `"build"` script in your project's `package.json`. If your deployment platform accepts a build command, ensure this is set to `npm run build`.

```json title="package.json" "--remote"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "astro build --remote"
  }
}
```

### Set your environment secret

You need to create an app token to access your Studio database from a production deploy. You can create an app token from your Studio project dashboard by navigating to the **Settings** tab and selecting **Tokens**. 

Copy the generated token and apply as an environment variable / environment secret in your deployment platform using the name `ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN`.
